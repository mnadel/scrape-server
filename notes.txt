Your Nerves project was created successfully.

You should now pick a target. See https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content
for supported targets. If your target is on the list, set `MIX_TARGET`
to its tag name:

For example, for the Raspberry Pi 3 you can either
  $ export MIX_TARGET=rpi3
Or prefix `mix` commands like the following:
  $ MIX_TARGET=rpi3 mix firmware

If you will be using a custom system, update the `mix.exs`
dependencies to point to desired system's package.

Now download the dependencies and build a firmware archive:
  $ cd scrape_server
  $ mix deps.get
  $ mix firmware

If your target boots up using an SDCard (like the Raspberry Pi 3),
then insert an SDCard into a reader on your computer and run:
  $ mix firmware.burn

Plug the SDCard into the target and power it up. See target documentation
above for more information and other targets.
